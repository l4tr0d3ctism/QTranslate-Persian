## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Grouped theme selector** — Appearance settings now organises themes into Light, Dark, and Installed sections with bold section headers; a new "Sync with OS" checkbox replaces the flat "OS Default" entry and disables the dropdown when checked
- **Hotkey recorder redesign** — IntelliJ-style dialog: left-aligned action label above a plain text field with an embedded `+` button for selecting special keys (Enter, Escape, Tab, F1–F12, arrow keys, etc.) that cannot be typed directly; global hotkeys are paused while the recorder is open to prevent accidental triggers
- **Alt+1 / Alt+2 / Alt+3 focus shortcuts** — configurable in Settings → Keyboard & Hotkeys; work in all layouts including Compact (tabbed) mode
- **Compact layout tab tooltips** — each tab shows its keyboard shortcut in the tooltip

### Fixed
- Target language is now remembered across sessions — no longer resets to Arabic on every launch (#92)
- Tab key in the input pane now moves focus instead of inserting a literal tab character; Ctrl+Tab inserts a tab
- Caret is always visible in read-only output panes regardless of theme
- `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+X` and text drag-out reliably work in the input pane
- Translator service order in the selector is now stable across JVM restarts
- Key chip text in the Hotkeys table now renders with proper LCD/ClearType antialiasing
- Combo box height in Appearance settings is consistent with all other combo boxes on the page

### Changed
- All 12 non-English locale files fully translated — 20 previously English-only keys now localised (hotkey recorder strings, focus action names, default language settings, compact layout tooltips, theme group headers)

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Quick Dictionary** — global `Ctrl+D` hotkey, floating panel with auto-lookup on selected text
- **Translation history** dialog — view, restore, and clear past translations
- **AdvancedTextPane** — hint text, character count overlay, and theme-safe wavy spell-check underlines in the input area
- **Clickable ERROR/WARNING status chip** — opens `ErrorDetailPopup` with scrollable full-message and Copy button
- **Output panel hint text** guiding new users (all 13 locales)
- **Markdown-rendered release notes** in the update dialog with "View on GitHub" button
- **Quick Translate popup overhaul** — configurable idle timers, interruptible fades, 120 ms mouse-exit debounce, screen-bounds hit test
- **Customizable SHOW_MAIN_WINDOW hotkey** with independent Double-Ctrl toggle option
- **AI Services plugin v2.0.0** — OpenRouter-first single endpoint, 300+ models via one API key, AI Dictionary service, AI Vision OCR service, HTTP 402 error handling
- **Plugin settings annotation system v2** — `@SettingGroup`/`@SettingGroups`, `@PluginAction`, `SLIDER` type, `showIf` conditional visibility, inline field validation, character counters
- **Stop TTS playback mid-audio** — Listen button becomes Stop while audio is playing
- **OCR snap dialog action bar** — Copy Text, Copy Image, Save Image, Re-crop buttons, and selection dimensions overlay
- **About dialog redesign** with updated team and contact links
- **In-app donation nudge** — Support button in About dialog; one-time milestone notification at 500 translations
- `FUNDING.yml` — GitHub Sponsors and Buy Me a Coffee links on the repository sidebar
- **ThemeManager overhaul** — platform-aware defaults (macOS → mac dark/light, Linux → ReSharper dark/light, Windows → flat dark/light), OS dark/light mode detection, animated cross-fade transitions
- **"OS Default" theme option** in Appearance settings — follows system dark/light preference at apply time
- **Settings dialog overhaul** — two-column Services grid, keyboard shortcut chip badges, text wrapping throughout, PluginsPanel with chip-wrapped service list and always-visible action bar
- **Structured notification system** — status bar chips, in-app update dialog, `StatusCode`-based localized status messages
- Streaming TTS audio URL support — long audio is played while downloading rather than waiting for the full file
- Instant translate improvements — output clears on blank input; minimum-character guard prevents spurious requests
- All 13 language files synced with the latest `embedded_en.toml` structure; missing keys translated

### Fixed
- Thin indeterminate progress bar in status bar during translation (replaces the old circular spinner)
- Output panels are now read-only with a "Set as Input" context menu — translation results can't be accidentally edited
- Input area stays editable while a translation is in progress — no more blocked/greyed state
- Configurable translate keyboard shortcut (was hardcoded to `Enter`)
- About dialog links correctly wired: "How to Use" → GitHub wiki, "Contact Us" → new GitHub issue
- DictionaryResultView no longer flickers on settings save or language switch
- In-flight translation cancelled immediately when new input arrives
- Settings action wired correctly in system tray menu
- Localization thread safety — string caches upgraded to `ConcurrentHashMap`
- MainStore input race condition — state captured atomically before update
- Hotkey double-registration race — guarded with `AtomicBoolean.compareAndSet`
- Hardcoded English strings in Quick Translate popup and Preset Selector replaced with localized equivalents
- Config deserialization safety — all `Configuration` fields have defaults; `ConfigMigrator` upgrades old config files without data loss
- `NotificationBus` replay guard — stale notifications (> 5 s old) are discarded on new subscriber to prevent duplicate chips after UI rebuild
- Popup multi-monitor position — `GraphicsConfiguration` derived from current mouse position, not the dialog's current screen
- Window panel transparency minimum guard (20 %) and idle-timeout minimum (2 s)
- TOML localization quoting — all non-English language files now correctly escape `\"` inside dictionary not-found messages

### Fixed
- "Auto-Detect" label and "Default" preset name now fully localized; close dialog redesigned
